# Documentation for Distributed System

In order to run the system, the server.py file must be executed first. This can be done through python, or through the command line via  
`python server.py`  
The server takes some time to start up. Once it is ready, the message 'Server is ready' will be displayed. This file starts up the front-end server, the back-end server as well as the name server.


Once the server has been set up, the client.py can be executed in the same manner as the server file. The client's initial connection to the server may take a while.


The distributed system uses [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/) as an external web-service.
